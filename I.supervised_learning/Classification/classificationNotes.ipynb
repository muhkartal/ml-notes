    "**Decision Trees (DTs)** are non-parametric supversied learning methos used for _classification_ and _regression_. The goal is o create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferrred from data features. **A tree** can be seen a piecewise constant approximation.\n",
